# Pintrest UI

## Description
Hello Everyone! 

Just thought I would try a full session of coding and show you what my workflow looks like for front end development. In this project I took a simple clean redesign of Pintrest that I found online on uplabs and then recreated it with Vuetify. As you can see the material design framework is really powerful and can speed up your workflow significantly.
